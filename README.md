# 10 Object-oriented Programming: SVG Logo Maker

My challenge was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application will prompt the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.
